<!-- Where Does it Go?
Your application needs a container to put the content provided by the routing.

This container is the ng-view directive.

There are three different ways to include the ng-view directive in your application:

Example:
<div ng-view></div>
Example:
<ng-view></ng-view>
Example:
<div class="ng-view"></div>
Applications can only have one ng-view directive, and this will be the placeholder for all views provided by the route. -->
