<!-- What do I Need?
To make your applications ready for routing, you must include the AngularJS Route module:

<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular-route.js"></script>
Then you must add the ngRoute as a dependency in the application module:

var app = angular.module("myApp", ["ngRoute"]);
Now your application has access to the route module, which provides the $routeProvider.

Use the $routeProvider to configure different routes in your application:

app.config(function($routeProvider) {
  $routeProvider
  .when("/", {
    templateUrl : "main.htm"
  })
  .when("/red", {
    templateUrl : "red.htm"
  })
  .when("/green", {
    templateUrl : "green.htm"
  })
  .when("/blue", {
    templateUrl : "blue.htm"
  });
}); -->
